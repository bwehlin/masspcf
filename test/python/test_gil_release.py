"""Test that the GIL is released during blocking C++ computations.

Uses a GatedTask: a C++ StoppableTask that blocks until Python calls
advance() a specified number of times.  If wait_for() held the GIL,
the thread calling wait_for could never yield to let the main thread
call advance(), and the test would deadlock.
