Subsampling
===========

This guide covers :func:`~stablebear.sampling.subsample_relative`, the front end of the
*relative approach* to topological data analysis of Agerberg, Chachólski &
Ramanujam :footcite:`Agerberg2023`. Subsampling turns a single reference point cloud into a tensor
of subsamples drawn *relative to* a set of query points, which then feeds
directly into the :doc:`persistent homology pipeline <persistence>`.


Background
==========

In the relative approach, the topology of a data set is probed *from the
viewpoint of* chosen query points. For each query point :math:`p` and the
reference point cloud :math:`R`, a probability over the reference points is
formed by applying a **filter** to each pair :math:`(p, r)` and passing the
result through a **distribution** :math:`D`:

.. math::

   \mathrm{prob}(r) \propto D\big(\mathrm{filter}(p, r)\big),\quad r \in R.

``n_instances`` subsamples of up to ``sample_size`` points each are then drawn
from :math:`R` according to that probability. With the default filter (Euclidean
distance) and a Gaussian distribution, this concentrates each query point's
subsamples on the reference points near it, so the persistent homology of those
subsamples describes the local shape of the data around that query point.


Quick example
=============

:func:`~stablebear.sampling.subsample_relative` and the built-in distributions are
re-exported at the top level, so the common case needs a single import::

   import stablebear as sb
   import numpy as np

   reference = np.random.randn(500, 3)   # the data, shape (n_reference, dim)
   query     = np.random.randn(10, 3)    # 10 points to view it from

   # Default: Euclidean-distance filter + Gaussian(mean=0, sigma=1)
   subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, query, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000)

   print(subs.shape)      # (10, 2000)   -> one row of subsamples per query point
   print(subs[0, 0].shape) # (30, 3)     -> a single subsample is a point cloud

The result is a :class:`~stablebear.PointCloudTensor` of shape
``(n_query, n_instances)``; element ``[i, j]`` is the ``j``-th subsample (a
``(sample_size, dim)`` point cloud) drawn for query point ``i``.

If ``query`` is omitted, the reference cloud is used as its own set of query
points::

   subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000)
   # subs.shape == (500, 2000)


Reference and query points
===========================

``reference`` and ``query`` may each be a NumPy array, any array-like, or a
:class:`~stablebear.FloatTensor` of shape ``(n_points, dim)``. They must share
the same ambient dimension ``dim``. The dtype of the result follows the
reference: a ``float32`` reference produces ``pcloud32`` subsamples, a
``float64`` reference produces ``pcloud64``.


Distributions
=============

The reference points are scored by their Euclidean distance
:math:`\lVert p - r \rVert` to the query point (computed in parallel in C++),
and the distribution turns that distance into a non-negative sampling weight.
Pass one of the built-in specs (:class:`~stablebear.Gaussian` or
:class:`~stablebear.Uniform`) via the ``distribution`` keyword; the default is
``Gaussian(mean=0.0, sigma=1.0)``. The whole probability-and-draw computation
then runs in a single fused C++ pass.

Distribution parameters are **keyword-only** — ``Uniform(high=3.0)``, never
``Uniform(3.0)`` — so which region a spec describes is always explicit at the
call site and a lone value cannot silently be taken for the wrong parameter.

.. note::

   Pluggable distance/filter functions are planned; for now the score is always
   Euclidean distance.

The choice of distribution decides *which* reference points a query point is
likely to draw. The figure below colours each reference point by its sampling
weight for a single query point (the star): a small-``sigma`` Gaussian
concentrates the weight on the immediate neighbourhood, while a ``Uniform``
band gives equal weight to a shell at a fixed range of distances and zero
elsewhere.

Gaussian
--------

:class:`~stablebear.Gaussian` is an unnormalized Gaussian of the filter value,

.. math::

   D(v) = \exp\!\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\left(\frac{v - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2\right).

With the default distance filter, this concentrates sampling on reference points
whose distance to the query point is near :math:`\mu`. Sample close to each query
point with a small ``sigma`` around ``mean=0``, or focus on a shell at distance
:math:`\mu` by setting ``mean``::

   # Favour the immediate neighbourhood of each query point
   subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, query, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000,
                                distribution=sb.Gaussian(mean=0.0, sigma=0.5))

   # Favour reference points about distance 2 away
   subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, query, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000,
                                distribution=sb.Gaussian(mean=2.0, sigma=0.5))

Uniform
-------

:class:`~stablebear.Uniform` puts equal weight on every reference point whose
filter value lies in a band :math:`[\text{low}, \text{high}]` and zero weight
outside it. With the distance filter this samples uniformly from a region defined
by distance to the query point:

- a **disk** of radius :math:`r` -- ``Uniform(high=r)``;
- an **annulus** between radii :math:`r_1` and :math:`r_2` --
  ``Uniform(low=r1, high=r2)``;
- everything **beyond** distance :math:`r` -- ``Uniform(low=r)``;
- the **whole** reference cloud -- ``Uniform()`` (the default ``low=0``,
  ``high=`` :math:`\infty`).

::

   subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, query, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000,
                                distribution=sb.Uniform(low=1.0, high=3.0))

.. note::

   **Plain uniform sampling does not depend on the query points.** With the
   default distance filter and a fully-open ``Uniform()`` (or any distribution
   that weights every reference point equally), the sampling probability is the
   same for every query point, so the ``n_query`` rows of the output are just
   independent draws from one identical distribution. Pass a **single** query
   point in that case (e.g. ``query=reference[:1]``) and raise ``n_instances``
   if you need more subsamples -- adding query points only multiplies redundant
   work.

   The one good reason to keep several query points under a uniform
   distribution is to **preserve the** ``(n_query, n_instances)`` **output
   shape** -- for instance to drop a uniform baseline into a pipeline that
   otherwise compares query-dependent distributions, without changing the
   tensor shapes the downstream code expects. (A *banded* ``Uniform(low,
   high)`` does depend on the query point, so this caveat applies only to the
   fully-open default.)

Drawing controls
================

- ``sample_size`` -- maximum number of points in each subsample (``s`` in the
  paper). With replacement (the default) every subsample has exactly
  ``sample_size`` points as long as at least one reference point carries
  positive weight for the query. Without replacement a subsample holds
  distinct points only, so it shrinks to the number of positively-weighted
  reference points when fewer than ``sample_size`` are available -- for
  example a narrow ``Uniform`` band around an isolated query point, or a
  ``sample_size`` larger than the reference cloud itself.
- ``n_instances`` -- number of subsamples drawn per query point (``n`` in the
  paper). This becomes the second axis of the output tensor.
- ``replace`` -- whether each subsample is drawn with replacement. Default
  ``True`` (as in the paper).
- ``generator`` -- a :class:`stablebear.random.Generator` for reproducible
  draws. If omitted, the global generator is used. Passing a seeded generator
  makes the subsamples reproducible::

     g = sb.random.Generator(seed=0)
     subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, query, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000,
                                  generator=g)

- ``verbose`` -- if ``True``, show a progress bar while the subsamples are drawn
  and allow cooperative cancellation (e.g. via ``KeyboardInterrupt``).

.. note::

   **Empty regions.** A query point for which *no* reference point has positive
   weight -- e.g. a ``Uniform`` band that no reference point falls in -- yields
   *empty* (0-point) subsamples; with ``verbose=True``, ``subsample_relative``
   emits a ``UserWarning`` naming the affected query points. Degenerate
   distribution *parameters* (``high <= low``, ``sigma <= 0``) are instead
   rejected when the distribution object is constructed, so an empty subsample
   always means a validly-specified region that happens to contain no
   reference points.


Feeding into persistent homology
=================================

Because ``subsample_relative`` returns a :class:`~stablebear.PointCloudTensor`, its output
drops straight into the :doc:`persistent homology pipeline <persistence>`.
Computing persistent homology over the subsamples and averaging the resulting
stable ranks over the ``n_instances`` axis yields one **relative stable rank**
per query point::

   import stablebear as sb
   from stablebear import persistence

   reference = np.random.randn(500, 3)
   query     = np.random.randn(10, 3)

   subs = sb.subsample_relative(reference, query, sample_size=30, n_instances=2000)
   # subs.shape == (10, 2000)

   bcs  = persistence.compute_persistent_homology(subs, max_dim=1)
   # bcs.shape == (10, 2000, 2)   -> H0 and H1 for every subsample

   srs  = persistence.barcode_to_stable_rank(bcs)
   # srs.shape == (10, 2000, 2)

   rel  = sb.mean(srs, dim=1)
   # rel.shape == (10, 2)   -> one relative stable rank per query point, per H_n

The averaging step over ``dim=1`` collapses the ``n_instances`` subsamples into
a single summary, so ``rel[i, n]`` is the mean :math:`H_n` stable rank seen from
query point ``i``. These per-query-point invariants can then be compared with
:func:`~stablebear.pdist`, averaged further, or used as features downstream.
