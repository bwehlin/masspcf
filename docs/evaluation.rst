Evaluation & Reductions
========================

Evaluation
==========

PCF tensors are callable — every element can be evaluated at one or more times
in a single call.

Consider a small example with two PCFs::

   import numpy as np
   import masspcf as mpcf

   # f(t) = 1 on [0,1), 4 on [1,3), 2 on [3,inf)
   f = mpcf.Pcf(np.array([[0, 1], [1, 4], [3, 2]], dtype=np.float32))

   # g(t) = 1 on [0,2), 2 on [2,inf)
   g = mpcf.Pcf(np.array([[0, 1], [2, 2]], dtype=np.float32))

      :language: python

Arrange them in a 2x2 tensor::

   X = mpcf.zeros((2, 2))
   X[0, 0] = f
   X[0, 1] = g
   X[1, 0] = 0.5 * g
   X[1, 1] = f

Scalar evaluation
-----------------

Pass a single number to get one value per PCF. The result is a NumPy array
with the same shape as the tensor::

   X(2)
   # array([[4., 2.],
   #        [1., 4.]], dtype=float32)

      :language: python

Array evaluation
----------------

Pass an array of times to evaluate every PCF at every time. The time
dimensions are appended to the tensor shape::

   times = np.array([1, 2, 4], dtype=np.float32)
   X(times)
   # shape (2, 2, 3) -- tensor shape (2,2) + times shape (3,)
   # array([[[4. , 4. , 2. ],
   #         [1. , 2. , 2. ]],
   #        [[0.5, 1. , 1. ],
   #         [4. , 4. , 2. ]]], dtype=float32)

   .. literalinclude:: _static/gen_tensor_eval_fig.py
      :pyobject: plot_tensor_eval_array
      :language: python

Multi-dimensional time arrays work too::

   t2d = np.array([[1, 2],
                    [3, 4]], dtype=np.float32)
   X(t2d).shape  # (2, 2, 2, 2) -- tensor shape + times shape

Lists are converted to NumPy arrays internally::

   X([1, 2, 4])  # same as X(np.array([1, 2, 4]))

Float tensor evaluation
-----------------------

Passing a :py:class:`~masspcf.FloatTensor`
returns a tensor of the same type::

   t = mpcf.FloatTensor(np.array([1, 2, 4], dtype=np.float32))
   result = X(t)  # returns a FloatTensor of shape (2, 2, 3)

Time complexity
---------------

The input times do not need to be sorted. When evaluating at multiple times, the library automatically sorts them so that the breakpoints can be scanned in a single linear pass, then maps the results back to the original order.

.. note::

   Let :math:`n` denote the number of breakpoints in a PCF and :math:`m` the number of query times.

   - **Single PCF, single time:** :math:`O(\log n)` (binary search).
   - **Single PCF, m times:** :math:`O(m \log m + m + n)`. The query times are sorted in :math:`O(m \log m)`, then a single linear scan advances two pointers -- one through the :math:`m` sorted times, one through the :math:`n` breakpoints -- giving :math:`O(m + n)`.
   - **Tensor of N PCFs, m times:** :math:`O(m \log m + N(m + n))`. The sort happens once; each PCF is scanned in :math:`O(m + n)`.

   Here :math:`n` denotes the average number of breakpoints when PCFs have different sizes.


Reductions
==========

Reductions collapse a tensor along a specified dimension. The ``dim`` parameter
selects which axis to reduce over: every "slice" along that axis is combined
into a single output value.

.. _tensors-how-dim-works:

How ``dim`` works
-----------------

Consider a 2-D tensor ``A`` of shape ``(m, n)``:

.. code-block:: text

   A = [ [ A[0,0]  A[0,1]  ...  A[0,n-1] ],       shape (m, n)
         [ A[1,0]  A[1,1]  ...  A[1,n-1] ],
           ...
         [ A[m-1,0] A[m-1,1] ... A[m-1,n-1] ] ]

**Reducing along dim=0** (the row axis) combines elements that share the same
column index. For each column ``j``, the elements ``A[0,j], A[1,j], ...,
A[m-1,j]`` are reduced together. The result has shape ``(n,)``::

   # result[j] = reduce(A[0,j], A[1,j], ..., A[m-1,j])
   result = mpcf.mean(A, dim=0)    # shape (n,)

**Reducing along dim=1** (the column axis) combines elements that share the same
row index. For each row ``i``, the elements ``A[i,0], A[i,1], ..., A[i,n-1]``
are reduced together. The result has shape ``(m,)``::

   # result[i] = reduce(A[i,0], A[i,1], ..., A[i,n-1])
   result = mpcf.mean(A, dim=1)    # shape (m,)

In general, for a tensor of shape ``(d_0, d_1, ..., d_k)``, reducing along
``dim=j`` produces a result of shape ``(d_0, ..., d_{j-1}, d_{j+1}, ..., d_k)``
-- the ``j``-th dimension is removed, and each position in the output
corresponds to the reduction of all elements along that axis.

When the result would be a single element (a tensor of shape ``(1,)``), masspcf
returns a scalar (a ``Pcf`` or a ``float``) directly rather than a 1-element
tensor.

mean
----

:py:func:`~masspcf.mean` computes the pointwise average of PCFs along a dimension::

   import masspcf as mpcf
   from masspcf.random import noisy_sin

   X = noisy_sin((50,), n_points=100)

   # Average all 50 functions into a single Pcf
   avg = mpcf.mean(X, dim=0)

For a higher-dimensional tensor, the specified dimension is collapsed::

   A = mpcf.zeros((3, 100))
   # ... fill A ...

   # Average across dim=1: result has shape (3,)
   row_means = mpcf.mean(A, dim=1)

   # Average across dim=0: result has shape (100,)
   col_means = mpcf.mean(A, dim=0)

max_time
--------

:py:func:`~masspcf.max_time` finds the maximum time value (the rightmost breakpoint) across PCFs along a dimension::

   t_max = mpcf.max_time(X, dim=0)

The result is a numeric value (or numeric tensor), not a PCF. This is useful for
aligning PCFs for plotting or further analysis.


Combining it all
================

Here is a complete example that creates a tensor of noisy sine and cosine functions, computes their means, and plots the result:
