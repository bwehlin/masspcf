    for all :math:`t`.

    See :ref:`tensors-how-dim-works` for a detailed explanation of dimension
    reduction semantics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fs : PcfContainerLike
        A ``PcfTensor`` with dtype ``pcf32`` or ``pcf64``.
    dim : int, optional
        Dimension along which to reduce, by default 0.

    Returns
    -------
    PcfTensor
        A ``PcfTensor`` with the reduced dimension removed.

    For each PCF :math:`f_i` with breakpoints

    :math:`T_i = t_{n_i-1}^{(i)}` be the last breakpoint. For functions
    :math:`f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_n` being reduced, this returns

    .. math::
        \max(T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n).

    The result is numeric, not a PCF.

    See :ref:`tensors-how-dim-works` for a detailed explanation of dimension
    reduction semantics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fs : PcfContainerLike
        A ``PcfTensor`` with dtype ``pcf32`` or ``pcf64``.
    dim : int, optional
        Dimension along which to reduce, by default 0.

    Returns
    -------
    FloatTensor
        A numeric tensor with the reduced dimension removed.
